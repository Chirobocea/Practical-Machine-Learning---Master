# Practical Machine Learning - Master of Artificial Intelligence

Welcome to the repository for the Practical Machine Learning course, completed as part of the Masterâ€™s program in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Bucharest. This repository contains two distinct projects that explore different facets of machine learning: supervised classification and unsupervised classification.

## Repository Overview

This repository includes two projects:

1. **Supervised Classification**: This project focuses on supervised learning techniques for classification tasks. It involves building and evaluating models that learn from labeled training data to make predictions on unseen data.

2. **Unsupervised Classification**: This project explores unsupervised learning methods for classification. It includes techniques for clustering and dimensionality reduction, where the models learn patterns and groupings from unlabeled data.

Each project is accompanied by a detailed report documenting the methodology, results, and insights.
